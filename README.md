Papyrus
========================================================================

Papyrus is an accessible content delivery and student management application. It was originally developed by Taras Danylak at York University Libraries. Its core purpose is to provide a delivery system for online books, articles and course kits to students with disabilities. Another prominent function of Papyrus is to keep track of and help manage student accessibility information, as well as act as a repository for electronic books, articles and course kits.

## Getting started
